# HTML-Table-data-extraction
This is a TopCoder project: Unstructured text mining is the key the future of data science.  Many data sources provide valuable data in unstructured and semi-structured formats.  Frequently, tables in HTML are messy, and complex to find within large bodies of text.  Headers change, can be misaligned, numbers can be in different formats.   The tables titles are frequently labeled outside the table structure. Mastering the extraction of this information in a generic way can provide a very powerful tool for understanding many different forms of data.   Our goal in this project is to build a tool that takes an html file as input and as the output produces structured text in JSON format with data from the tables in the document. For example, given a table in this image
